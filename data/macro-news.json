    "content": "Bitcoin surpassed the $80,000 mark for the first time in history, reaching a new all-time high. The surge is attributed to the continuous flow of institutional capital into Bitcoin ETFs, which have accumulated over $25 billion in assets under management since their launch in January. 'The market is reacting to Bitcoin's legitimization as an institutional asset class,' stated Sarah Peterson, a strategist at Goldman Sachs. The price increase comes amid expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and concerns about inflation, reinforcing Bitcoin's narrative as a hedge against monetary devaluation.",
